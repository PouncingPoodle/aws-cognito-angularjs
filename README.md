# aws-cognito-angularjs
A template to work from when starting out with cognito or to use as reference.

This is a template I work from when I need to implement AWS Cognito in my application. 

I worked from takanorig's repo and added a few extra things. For more documentation of how to implement things - go to this repo https://github.com/takanorig/aws-cognito-angularjs.

Thank you very much takanorig, I struggled a lot and your repo clarified everything.
